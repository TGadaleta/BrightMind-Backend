**A student-driven approach to learning.**

Current backend for BrightMind app. Currently can create a user, join preset dummy classes as a user, and can create todo items. Wanted to try building this as a precursor to an app when teachers can post their classes online and students can join the classes to work through the lesson at their own pace.
